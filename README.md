✅ Title

IoT-Based Smart Water Distribution Monitoring System

✅ Problem

Cities lose massive amounts of water due to pipeline leaks, pressure imbalance, and lack of real-time monitoring. Traditional inspection methods are slow and inefficient, resulting in high Non-Revenue Water and resource wastage.

✅ Solution

Our system uses pressure and flow sensors connected to an Arduino to continuously monitor pipeline conditions. When abnormal pressure patterns are detected, the system flags a potential leak and alerts authorities through a real-time dashboard.
